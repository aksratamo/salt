# Linux server Salt Config
This is my Linux server salt school project
I'm doing a advanced linux server management [course](http://terokarvinen.com/2018/aikataulu-%e2%80%93-palvelinten-hallinta-ict4tn022-3004-ti-ja-3002-to-%e2%80%93-loppukevat-2018-5p)
My goal is to make an ever growing [SaltStack](https://www.saltstack.com/) config with version history for each week.
